Experimenting, poking at concurrent Rust with FFI

In this repository is a simple C++ program (`main.cpp`) linking to a Rust library with bindings generated by `cbindgen`.

I threw it together to try out some stateful concurrent Rust code exposed via FFI.

## Prerequisites

- cargo
- a C++ compiler
- make

## Building

Run `make`.
